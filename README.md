# Probability-Calculator-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem solving work, as part of the fifteenth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([Probability-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Probability-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Probability-Calculator.py)), which performed statistical experiments on balls selected from a hat. The `Hat` class was first defined for this, which allowed hats to be initialised that contained `n` balls of varying colours. This was initialised as a list, and the `draw` method was next defined. This allowed a given number of balls to be selected from the hat. The `experiment` function was next defined outside of this class, which repeatedly withdrew a given number of balls from a hat defined with the previous `Hat` class. This function repeated these experiments `n` times, whose outcomes were compared to their expected values for each colour ball in the hat. Provided that the two matched, a counter was incremented to reflect this. This was returned as a percentage of all experiments ran. This allowed users to estimate the probability that certain numbers of balls were chosen from different bags, for statistical inference. The requirements for this were exported as a PDF from the project UI and annotated with [in-depth problem solving approaches](https://github.com/franpanteli/Probability-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf). These were written into Python in the project [Probability-Calculator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Probability-Calculator-Python-Project/blob/main/Probability-Calculator.py) file, which was then submitted to mark the successful completion of the fifteenth project in the certification. This enabled me to invest in my class and function defining skills with Python, aiding in developing my independent learning skills.
